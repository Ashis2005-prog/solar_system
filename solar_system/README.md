# 3D Solar System Simulation with Three.js

This project is a 3D simulation of our solar system built with Three.js. It includes all 8 planets orbiting the Sun with adjustable speeds and several interactive features.

## Features

- Realistic 3D rendering of the solar system
- Adjustable orbital speeds for each planet
- Pause/Resume functionality
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Interactive camera controls (pan, zoom, rotate)
- Responsive design that works on mobile devices
- Starry background

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser
3. No server required - it runs directly in the browser

## Controls

- Use the sliders to adjust the orbital speed of each planet
- Click "Pause" to stop all animations
- Click "Reset Speeds" to return to default speeds
- Click "Dark Mode" to toggle between light and dark themes
- Use your mouse to:
  - Left-click and drag to rotate the view
  - Right-click and drag to pan
  - Scroll to zoom in/out

## Technical Details

- Built with Three.js for 3D rendering
- Uses OrbitControls for camera interaction
- Implements a realistic animation loop with delta timing
- Responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Browser Support

Tested on:

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile Safari (iOS)
- Chrome for Android

## Future Improvements

- Add planet labels/tooltips
- Implement more accurate planet sizes and distances
- Add moons for planets that have them
- Include information panels about each planet
